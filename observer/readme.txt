Modify these classes to implement the Observer pattern so that Light objects
can be notified when the Button object is pressed.

1. In the Button class, add methods to attach, detach, and notify observers.
2. Make the Button class generic to allow any observer to be attached.
3. In the Driver class, create instances of Button, Light (Red, Green, Blue), and attach the Red and Blue lights to the button.
4. Press the button in the Driver class, and both Red and Blue lights should be turned on.
5. Follow any additional instructions present in comments.
